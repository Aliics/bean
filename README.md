# bean
_Another_ ktor project, which is not the be confused with *Spring Beans*.

# what does bean do?
Bean is an _HTTP micro-service_ which is a part of my chat service (which currently does not have a name). The primary
task of bean is handle public-facing requests directly regarding chats.

# what other services are there?
As of right now, bean is the only one. However, I will be creating more for tasks like user management.

| micro-service | what it does |
|:---|:---|
| bean **[in progress]** | Messages and groups |
| toffee **[planned]** | User sessions (e.g, logins and group access). |
